# David Montesdeoca's website

Looking at this project, I wanna you focus on my way of working and thinking, rather than on its (non-existing) complexity. I'll try to show how I organize my code and will document whatever decisions I make, either with commit messages and/or with inline comments.

I'm aware that using Rails for such a project can be considered overengineering. Anyway, I'd like to build the same project using another Ruby framework such as [Hanami](http://hanamirb.org/), or another programming languages, such as [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/), [Go](https://golang.org/), [Python](https://www.python.org/) or [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/). *Just for fun*.
